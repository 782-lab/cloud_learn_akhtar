# my cloud learing notes
Hi there 
this is my personal note of cloud Computing what i have understood

# What is cloud computing
cloud computing is delivery of computing service like storage server database, software, and more over the internet without having to own them 

# Real-Life Analogy
Just like we pay for electricity as we use, similarly in cloud, we *pay only for what we use* — no need to buy big machines or set up our own data center.
