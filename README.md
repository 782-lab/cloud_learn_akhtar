# my cloud learing notes
Hi there 
this is my personal note of cloud Computing what i have understood

# What is cloud computing
cloud computing is delivery of computing service like storage server database, software, and more over the internet without having to own them 

# Real-Life Analogy
Just like we pay for electricity as we use, similarly in cloud, we *pay only for what we use* — no need to buy big machines or set up our own data center.

 # Features of Cloud Computing
- *On-Demand Access* – Use when you need it
- *Pay-as-you-go* – No upfront investment
- *Scalable* – Increase or decrease resources easily
- *Accessible from anywhere* – You just need the internet
- *Highly Secure* – Handled by big cloud providers



- # hello
